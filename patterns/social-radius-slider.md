Social networks are mentally taxing. Sometimes news from around the world is inspiring, other times it is just depressing. Sometimes you want to hear from
strangers, other times you just want posts from your closest friends and family. Wanting to proactively manage your feed for your mental health requires a lot
of overhead.

## The Design Solution
