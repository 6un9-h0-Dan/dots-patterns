## The Design Problem

Decentralized tools are often conceived as alternatives to centralized tools. However, decentralized infrastructure often has unexpected UX consequences.

## The Design Solution

Explain your tool by referring to a more familiar tool. Meet your user where they are. How is your tool similar or different from this dominant tool?

### Examples
- Mattermost
- Rocket.chat
- Matrix.org/Element

## Why Choose Like Slack, but ?

New users get easily overwhelmed with new technologies.

## Best Practice: How to Implement Like Slack, but 

- Make sure you know your your audience and the technology they are familiar with beforehand to ensure a valid and meaninful onboarding process.
- Allow the audience to quickly grasp an overall understanding of how the new technologies work by not only mentioning their similarities but also 
emphasizing the differences. 

## Potential Problems with Like Slack, but 

- You will run into problems if the technology you are refering to is unknown to the user. In Slack's case, it's easy to imagine that non-"online
working professionals" will never have heard of Slack. 
- Using 'Like Slack, but' can also create false preconceptions and limit the audience's understanding to a certain degree. As such, it might risk taking
away the needs to migrate from the centralized world and imagine diffrent, decentralized ones. 

## The Take Away ##

Refer to more familiar technologies when you're explaining something new and complex.
